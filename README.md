This is Sky's first git project! :)

markdown generated from [here](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc#tocinsert)

Include the following in the README.md file:
```
<!-- toc -->

<!-- tocstop -->
```
Then in the terminal, type:
`markdown-toc -i -no-firsth1 <filename.md>`

The `-i` will directly write the TOC into the markdown file
`-no-firsth1` will ignore the first h1 tag in the markdown file
